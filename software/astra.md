---

The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB and Python toolbox of high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography. It supports 2D parallel and fan beam geometries, and 3D parallel and cone beam, with flexible source/detector positioning. The basic forward and backward projection operations are GPU-accelerated, and directly callable from MATLAB and Python to enable building new algorithms.

## Installation

The ASTRA Toolbox is easily available via conda in Linux for Python 2.7 and Python 3.5:

```bash
conda install -c astra-toolbox astra-toolbox
```

More general instructions are available at <http://astra-toolbox.com/docs/install.html>.

## Usage

There are Python samples available at <https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox/tree/master/samples/python>.
