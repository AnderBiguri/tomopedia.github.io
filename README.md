# tomopedia.github.io
A Wiki for tomography-related algorithms and software packages.

# Website structure

All main pages (e.g. 'software', 'algorithms') are found under `main_pages`. 
Pages for individual software packages and algorithms are found inside
folders. For example, the web page for FBP is found under `algorithms/fbp.md`.
All other files are only used for generating the website.

## Table formatting

Tables are not really well supported in markdown. The tables we have now render
well, but editing them is quite difficult. To help with editing, you can use a
markdown table editor, for example [this one](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).
